### what have been done soo far

1. A web based application:- (registration,visitor registration,criminal registration and tracking, API )

#### what need to be done
1. AI integration
- population migration data will help in strategict planning (infrastructural, roads,schools,hospitals)( this still need AI integration to predict demands based on
migrations)
2. crimainal recording (this is very assential as the country is opening boarders)
- This will involve crimime suspect registration and a suspect will be matched 
- entry matches ( we will use Ai to match suspected movermentent)
- cordinated cameras (street,event,home): for every registered iot system will involve cordination of information to help alloction: we will need AI for facial recognition

#### Permission registration
- in case a user need permission we will need the following
1. IOT: We will use IOT for every conference Hall to make sure every registered concered will have ann access point (for entry)
2. envitation will be given, paid direct on platform

# What are possiblr prediction using ML with population migration data
1. opulation Growth:

1. Predict the overall population growth based on the influx of visitors, new residents, and births.
Housing Demand:

2. Forecast the demand for housing based on the number of new residents and visitors turning into permanent residents. This can help in urban planning and real estate development.
Employment Trends:

3. Analyze the employment contracts registered in the system to predict job market trends and identify potential areas of skill demand.
Education Needs:

4. Predict the need for new educational institutions or expansions based on the increasing population, especially if there is a significant number of families with children.
Infrastructure Requirements:

5. Determine the need for new infrastructure such as roads, public transportation, and healthcare facilities based on population density and migration patterns.
Crime Rates:

6. Utilize data on registered suspects and crimes to predict potential crime hotspots and allocate resources accordingly for law enforcement.
Cultural and Social Services:

7. Predict the demand for cultural and social services based on the diversity of the population, helping in planning community events, language services, etc.
Economic Growth:

8. Analyze the data to make predictions about economic growth by assessing trends in employment, business registrations, and economic activities.
Healthcare Needs:

9. Predict healthcare requirements based on population growth and demographic data to ensure adequate healthcare facilities and services.
Environmental Impact:

10. Evaluate the environmental impact of population growth and migration to plan for sustainable development and conservation efforts.
Tourism Trends:

11. Predict tourism trends based on visitor data, helping in the development of tourist infrastructure and services.

Social Integration:

15. Assess the integration of new residents and visitors into the community, aiding in social programs and services.
Emergency Preparedness:

16. Use data to predict potential emergency situations and plan for disaster response and recovery.

## Deep learning
We will use Ai in cameras to connect information in terms of followind up crimanals also finger print access point will be used i conference areas
